Chippy has recently lost a lot of money on an investment fund due to economic and political instability. It has left him struggling to effectively run his company and pay his staff. Communication about his financial affairs has broken down over the last few months. This means that I am looking a Chippy's overview screen and see various penalty payments and interest on the total amount of tax due. I'm responsible for helping Chippy given his current precarious circumstances. <p>photo by <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/metalcowboy/1604662658/in/photolist-3rNjiy-atCcFM-nCBsjF-axgWCZ-ai9vy6-nCTLSd-semec4-axjCKC-atETEf-9pFzj7-axjCv1-7mKmcp-eYQKz7-cUMneL-atCetn-ai9viB-axjCFy-ai9vCK-atCbYi-eYQMxW-9UxthG-aicj19-eYQFwL-aPrKzV-qGzAJB-eYQLTw-eYDgbF-kxSuik-7mKsAx-atCdKR-9o8ar9-pn5Lbq-dyHtVR-8rADJk-ctV83f-fvqJKk-7QyySH-ai9vHx-7mPdY9-dC4vwZ-iCsRz-axgWeV-9o57Xz-axAreG-atCcbc-ai9va6-6E1rZb-a1h8tJ-dCtzLU-7QBTfN'>Swift Benjamin</a> under <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/'>CC BY 4.0</a></p>"
